# basic-contract-test
Basic solidity function and nodejs  app for testing

## Description
Let's say you have already implemented a standardized ERC-20 smart contract for some token.
Now you want to add the possibility of securely updating the balances between any two users, off-chain using state channel technique. 
Write simple JavaScript/TypeScript/NodeJS code that generates state channel receipts (signed by both users) and one Solidity function that validates that receipt and updates the balances accordingly? Note that these 2 users can update their balances off-chain multiple times before they actually want to settle it on-chain.
